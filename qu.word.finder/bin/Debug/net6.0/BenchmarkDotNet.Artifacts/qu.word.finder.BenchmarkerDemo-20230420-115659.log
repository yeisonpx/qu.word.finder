// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark BenchmarkerDemo.UsingLinqFinder: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmark BenchmarkerDemo.UsingLinqFinder returns a deferred execution result (IEnumerable<String>). You need to either change the method declaration to return a materialized result or consume it on your own. You can use .Consume() extension method to do that.

//    * Assembly qu.word.finder which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
